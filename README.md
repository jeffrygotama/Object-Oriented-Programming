# Object-Oriented-Programming

1. Encapsulation, forming a protective barrier around the information contained within a class from the rest of the code.


2. Abstraction, helps isolate the impact of changes made to the code, so that if something goes wrong, the change will only affect the implementation details of a class and not the outside code.

3. Inheritence, Classes can be organized into hierarchies, where a class might have one or more parent or child classes. Therefore, if a class inherits from another class, it automatically obtains a lot of the same functionality and properties from that class and can be extended to contain separate code and data.

4. Polymorphism, allows for the uniform treatment of classes in a hierarchy. Therefore, calling code only needs to be written to handle objects from the root of the hierarchy, and any object instantiated by any child class in the hierarchy will be handled in the same way
